# Analysis
The USA is outspending the other countries every year. The Military spending was viewed as change over time in both a percent and a fixed dollar amount. For the change from 2006-2016 in a fixed dollar amount, China has increased their spending the most. Also the UK and Italy have decreased their spending. For the percentage chagne china is still the country that increased their spending the most and that both Italy and the UK have decreased their spending. Canada and France have remained relatively flat. I would like to point out that the US looks like they have increased by much less when we think of it as a percent. As a percent of GDP, countries do not change there military expenditure by much year to year. As for spending per capita, most countries do not change much over time. Saudi Arbia does show an increase in 2012. Israel, USA and Saudi Arabia are the top three spenders per capita. For GDP per person Israel is ranked the highest.

Israel has most GDP per person
